# ASL-Recognition
### American Sign Language - Machine Learning Project Using Pytorch and Flask

This project was part of a Gitlab Group Project for a CS 196-25 Honors course that was an open-ended project of choice regarding a topic in AI. I ended up doing most of the project when the other group members got too busy, so I am sharing the work that I did on the project on my personal account.

Unless otherwise explicitly stated the work used is entirely my own code.
